ABSTRACT:

A machine learning model was developed to identify a concrete mixture having maximum strength while minimizing mixture weight using a dataset of various concrete mixes. This can be formally defined as maximization of (28âˆ’day compressive strength / mix weight). To do so, several machine learning techniques were employed, including three deep neural networks, a GAN model, and combinatorial pattern recognition. Ultimately, the developed neural network models were used to estimate the 28-day compressive strength of concrete mixtures, and optimization techniques were applied to find an optimal mix that maximizes the defined objective function. For the data set analyzed, the optimization model predicted a minimum ratio of mix weight to 28-day compressive strength of 31.611 kg/MPa.
